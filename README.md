## How to Prepare Eggplant

Wondering whether you can eat eggplant raw? It's OK in small quantities, but it's better if eggplant is cooked.
Traditionally, prepping eggplant for cooking required a number of time-consuming steps (salting, rinsing...). Instead,
use these strategies to ensure perfect eggplant with minimal fuss.

### Cut and Peel

Eggplant can be a low-maintenance prep kind of veggie. You might simply need to cut to the desired shape (round slices,
long strips, or a dice)—or just pierce the skin with a fork and roast it.

If your eggplant is larger and has a tougher skin (or you're just not a fan of eating eggplant skin), you can peel
eggplant with a vegetable peeler or paring knife.

### Salt (If You Want)

It's traditional to salt eggplant before you cook it—a technique that started way back when to reduce the bitterness and
help draw out moisture.

But eggplants today (especially if you pick smaller ones) aren't as bitter, so it's only really necessary for frying and
other cooking techniques where the moisture content really matters.

If you want to salt the eggplant before you cook it, slice it into rounds or dice the eggplant as needed for your
recipe, then lay the pieces out on a paper towel, salt generously, and layer it with more paper towels (and perhaps a
heavy pan to weigh it down). Let it sit for 45 minutes, then rinse the eggplant to wash away the excess salt and bitter
liquid.

### Don't Skimp on the Oil

Eggplant acts like a sponge when it cooks, so it'll soak up a lot of cooking liquid. Follow the recipe's liquid
measurements precisely to make sure you get the texture just right.

### Marinate for More Flavor

Eggplant can give you the same texture as meat for your meatless Monday recipes and has a mild flavor that can easily
pair with any flavors you bring into the dish—whether Mediterranean or a hearty Indian curry. Go ahead and marinate
eggplant in your favorite flavor combo to see what this veggie can do.
